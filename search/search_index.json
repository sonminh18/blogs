For example, assumpt that you're setup cluster by RKE or KubeKey with default configuration. It usually deploys a Calico as network plugin + kube-proxy and CoreDNS. The latency of DNS query will be increased when the number of pods are increasing. This is because kube-proxy is implementing with <code>iptables</code> and when a pod make a DNS request to CoreDNS, the traffic will be sent out via <code>iptables</code> and it has some limitations.</p> <p>https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/nodelocaldns/#motivation https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/issues/56903</p> <p>But in the other hand, NodeLocalDNS also has issue if you're using a <code>headless</code> service.</p>"},{"location":"posts/dns/ha-dns.html#what-if-dns-component-is-crashed","title":"What if DNS component is crashed??","text":"<p>As mentioned above, DNS is one of core component of Kubernetes Cluster, so when it is crashed, it means that all pods in cluster can not resolve DNS, even if pod calls a request to another pod inside cluster.
